Raspberry Pico ZX Spectrum Microdrive Hardware Emulator

Hardware emulation of 8 microdrives for the ZX Spectrum only (no plans to adapt this for the QL). Main features are:
- Supports all 8 Microdrives from one device
- OLED screen with buttons to navigate the menu - includes load, save & format cartridges as well as other options (see menu section below). No additional software or connections needed as all managed from the menu
- FAT32 & exFAT supported SD cards up to a theoretical 256TB (I've only tested a lowly 64GB which can easily fit every Spectrum game and program ever made multiple times)
- Reset button just in case (also makes it easier to flash the Pico)
- Buzzer in case you like a buzzing sound to "simulate" the drive motor
- Includes a version of my Z80onMDR tool (https://github.com/TomDDG/Z80onMDR_lite) to make it easy to load Z80 & SNA snapshots on the fly. Very useful as not many actual Microdrives cartridges released commercially.
- Fully powered from the Spectrum & boots instantly
- Unfortunately you do still need an IF1 (that is a future project)

Load up the SD card with all your favourite games and programs and enjoy hours of nostalgia with the blistering 15kB/sec transfer rate. Yes you can now load a game in a few seconds!

## Development

Built from the ground up using the the Pico C SDK (https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/). Uses Pico multicore to separate the time criticial emulation components running on the 2nd core to interrupt driven IO on the 1st.

Big thanks to Alex from OqtaDrive fame (https://codeberg.org/xelalexv/oqtadrive) for help with understanding the Microdrive hardware & toubleshooting.

Code makes extensive use of the excellent Pico SD Card Library by carlk3 (https://github.com/carlk3/no-OS-FatFS-SD-SPI-RPi-Pico). This gives full access to the also excellent small embedded systems FatFS (http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html).

## Connected to a ZX Spectrum

## The GUI

### Main Menu
- Power Off - not really required just don't switch off in the middle of a write as it could corrupt the files on the SD card
- Factory Reset - this creates 8 blank cartridges on the SD card root
- Eject SD Card - as it says, this safely unmounts the sd card so you can take it away and load up with more games
- Restart Emulation - Just resets the 2nd core, back button does the same at this level of the menu
- Cart 1 to 8 - Enter sub-menu for that specific Microdrive

### Microdrive Sub-Menu
- File Selector - enter the file explorer to navigate the folders on the SD card to select a file to load
- Cartridge Info - shows a basic CAT of the cartridge inserted
- Save Cartridge - creates a copy of the cartridge on the SD card so all your work doesn't get lost if you load a new cartridge into the drive
- Insert Formatted - as it says load a blank formatted (to 127kB) cartridge into the drive

The file explorer will only show compatible files, those with extension MDR, Z80 & SNA and directories.

## The Circuit

## BoM

- A Pico or Pico W
- Traco Power TSR 1-2450 (9v to 5v, 1 Amp) - https://www.tracopower.com/int/model/tsr-1-2450 (you can use alternatives these are just the best and very efficient, if you do use alternatives remember you may need additional circuitary)
- SparkFun Logic Level Converter - Bi-Directional (BOB-12009) - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009
- SSD1306 OLED 0.96" (you can get larger ones just make sure they are SSD1306). Be very careful of the GND & VCC placement as they are sometimes reversed
- Adafruit Micro SD SPI or SDIO Card Breakout Board - https://www.adafruit.com/product/4682
- 5 6Ã—6mm Right Angle Micro Push Buttons for mounting on the PCB (you can use any push button these are just the ones that I use)
- 2 Bi-Colour LEDs, common cathode (centre negative). Pick whatever colours you want and change the resistors to match.
- 6 1n4148 diodes
- 1 1n4001 diode for the 5v in, this is to allow USB to be connected and the Spectrum at the same time (any of the 400x series should work, I use 4004 as it was the one I had in stock)
- Piezo Buzzer (if you want annoying sounds)
- 2 470Ohm resistors for the data lines

## PCB

I have designed a prototype PCB to house everything. The prototype is missing the circuit to control Write Protect so it is always off (cartridges are unprotected so you can write to them), and there is no provision for passing COMMs down the chain for additional Microdrives.
